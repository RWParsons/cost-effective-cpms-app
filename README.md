# Cost-effective clinical prediction models

This shiny app accompanies a manuscript for obtaining value-optimising cutpoints for clinical prediction models. (manuscript will be linked once published.)

The source code is contained within this repository, along with some example data for the user to upload. The app is available online here: https://aushsi.shinyapps.io/cost-effective-cpms-app/

The app can also be run locally using:
```
shiny::runGitHub("RWParsons/cost-effective-cpms-app")
```
