# Cost-effective clinical prediction models

This shiny app accompanies a manuscript for obtaining value-optimizing cutpoints for clinical prediction models. The published paper is available here (<https://doi.org/10.1093/jamia/ocad042>).

The source code is contained within this repository, along with some example data for the user to upload. The app is available online here: (<https://aushsi.shinyapps.io/cost-effective-cpms-app/>).

The app can also be run locally using:
